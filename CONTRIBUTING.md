## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)

We support multiple languages through Chrome's i18n API.

### Adding New Strings

   ```json
   {
     "myNewString": {
       "message": "My new translatable string",
       "description": "Description for translators"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Use in code:**
   ```typescript
   import { getMessage } from '../utils/i18n';
   
   const text = getMessage('myNewString');
   ```

3. **Add translations** to other locale files (`src/locales/pt_br/messages.json`, etc.)

### Current Supported Languages

- English (`en`)
- Portuguese Brazil (`pt_br`)
